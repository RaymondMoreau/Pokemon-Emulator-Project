Raymond and Ashton's Pokémon Emulator project

GOAL:

To create a functioning backend for a Pokémon Emulator using Python.

PURPOSE:

Practice Python and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learn more about using GitHub as a method of co-ordinating with others in a coding project

Improve collaboration skills and decision making when working in a group


Discontinued as of 02/02/21 due to Ashton not making a single contribution and that we are learning Java, which will be a better object-oriented language for this project.
